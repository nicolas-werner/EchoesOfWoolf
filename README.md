# EchoesOfWoolf
Unveiling Intertextuality between Virginia Woolf's Diaries, Letters, and "Mrs. Dalloway"


## Project Description

"EchoesOfWoolf" is a project designed to explore the intertextual references between Virginia Woolf's personal writings—her diaries and letters—and one of her most celebrated novels, "Mrs. Dalloway". This project stands at the intersection of traditional literary analysis and computational literacy studies, leveraging  language models and vector databases to unearth the subtle threads that connect Woolf's lived experiences with her literary creations. A key ambition of "EchoesOfWoolf" is to benchmark the capabilities of large language models in discerning and interpreting complex literary relationships, thereby setting a precedent for future computational studies in literature.

## Objective
"EchoesOfWoolf" is driven by a dual-purpose agenda: to delve into the intertextual landscape of Virginia Woolf's body of work, particularly the echoes between her diaries, letters, and "Mrs. Dalloway", and to critically assess the utility of language models in the domain of computational literary analysis. This project is dedicated to systematically juxtaposing Woolf's personal and public writings to spotlight thematic and narrative convergences, employing computational tools to augment traditional literary inquiry. TBD

## Methodology TBD
- Data Collection: Assemble a comprehensive digital corpus comprising Virginia Woolf's diaries and letters, as well as the complete text of "Mrs. Dalloway".
- Vectorization: Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to convert the texts into vector forms, enabling sophisticated semantic comparisons.
- Analysis: Execute deep textual analysis through the deployment of large language models, aiming to identify recurring motifs, thematic overlaps, and explicit or nuanced references among the datasets.
- Benchmarking: ?
